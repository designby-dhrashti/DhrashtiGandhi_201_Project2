				<h1>AND HOW DO I KNOW ABOUT THIS STUFF?</h1>

So how do I do this? - well I can’t tell you but you will have to trust me on this! Simply navigate to the Fees section and lets catch catfish together.

				<h1>A LITTLE ORIGIN STORY ABOUT MY CAREER</h1>
				<p class="greytext">
					So what’s my story and why did I choose this unusual profession? The answer is simply to help stop this type of cyber activity which seems to affect people on the daily. <strong class="boldtext">Having the experience twice before - I simply decided that I wasn’t going to sit back and let these cruel selfish people get away with their deceit.</strong> I simply want people to be aware that not everything is as seems on the beautiful world of the internet and especially in this day and era where every bit of our social life is put on the web to portray our “perfect” lives.

Next thing I know I contact Catching Catfishers and found everything out about the person I was talking to for 7 months. After paying a small fee, Catching Catfishers sent me some photos of this guy and his email address — and that's all I needed to know this guy wasn’t who he was saying he was."

By the way, I highly recommend this service to anyone that suspects they are communicating with someone that is lying about who they are. I found out the person I was talking to was a 40 year old woman pretending to be a man and was trying to extort money out of me by telling me fake sob stories about her so-called debt."
